# blockchainProvenance
This is a simple example of a blockchain smart contract being used to track the location of items over time (item provenance).

This project uses the Truffle smart contract development environment, install Truffle then from the root directory of this project run:

    truffle test

and watch as the tests pass with flying colors. Then inspect the code in ./tests and ./contracts to see what you did. UI and actual functionality coming, but for now that's it.
